# Soil Type Classification

## Overview

This repository contains the code and models for a soil type classification project. The objective is to classify soil types based on a dataset of 2067 images belonging to 8 different classes: 'Chalky Soil', 'Mary Soil', 'Sand', 'Slit Soil', 'Alluvial Soil', 'Black Soil', 'Clay Soil', 'Red Soil'. The dataset has been augmented using various parameters to enhance the model's performance.

## Dataset Augmentation

The dataset augmentation process involved the following parameters:

- Rescale: 1./255
- Rotation Range: 20 degrees
- Width Shift Range: 0.2
- Height Shift Range: 0.2
- Zoom Range: 0.2
- Horizontal Flip: True
- Vertical Flip: True
- Fill Mode: Nearest

## Models

We have experimented with both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) including custom architectures and pretrained models, as well as traditional machine-learning models.

## Performance Metrics

The models were evaluated using a test set of 418 images, and the performance metrics are recorded in the following table:

| Model                  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Custom CNN             | 0.85     | 0.86      | 0.84   | 0.85     |
| Pretrained CNN         | 0.88     | 0.89      | 0.87   | 0.88     |
| Machine Learning Model | 0.78     | 0.80      | 0.76   | 0.78     |
